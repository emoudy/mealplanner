# FlavorBot - AI-Powered Recipe Management Platform

## Project Overview
A comprehensive AI-powered recipe management platform that leverages advanced language models to generate, personalize, and assist users in their culinary journey.

## Project Architecture

### Cross-Platform Monorepo Structure
FlavorBot has been restructured as a comprehensive cross-platform application with 70-80% code sharing between web, desktop (PWA), and mobile platforms:
