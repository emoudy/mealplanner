# MealPlanner - AI-Powered Recipe Management Platform

## Overview
MealPlanner is a comprehensive AI-powered recipe management platform with secure email authentication and email verification. The platform provides recipe generation, management, and culinary assistance through an intelligent chatbot interface.

## Authentication System (Mock Email Service)
The app currently uses a mock email service for development. When you register:

1. **Registration**: Creates account but requires email verification
2. **Mock Email**: Verification details are logged to the server console
3. **Verification**: Use the logged token and URL to verify your account
4. **Login**: Only works after email verification

### Development Workflow
1. Register a new account through the `/auth` page
2. Check the server console for verification details
3. Visit the verification URL or use the `/verify-email` page
4. Log in with your verified account

## Deploying to AWS

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- PostgreSQL database
- Email service credentials (Gmail, SendGrid, etc.)

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/database

# Session Security
SESSION_SECRET=your-secure-session-secret

# Email Service (for production)
EMAIL_SERVICE=gmail
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-password

# Or use SendGrid
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your-sendgrid-api-key
```

### Installation
```bash
# Clone and install dependencies
npm install

# Set up database
npm run db:push

# Start the application
npm run dev
```

### Replacing Mock Email Service
To enable real email sending, update `server/auth.ts`:

1. Replace the mock console logging with actual email sending
2. Use the email service of your choice (Gmail, SendGrid, AWS SES, etc.)
3. Add proper email templates and error handling

Example email implementation locations:
- `server/auth.ts` - Registration endpoint
- Email templates can be added to `server/email/` directory
- Configure email service in `server/email-service.ts`
